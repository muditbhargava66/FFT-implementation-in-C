### Changed
- **Breaking: API Redesign**: 
  - Old: `radix2_dit_fft(signal, n, FFT_FORWARD)`
  - New: `fft_auto(signal, signal, n, -1)` or use planning API
- **Breaking: Direction Constants**: 
  - Now use -1 for forward FFT, +1 for inverse (was enum)
- **Improved Algorithm Selection**: More intelligent selection based on factorization
- **Better Memory Management**: All algorithms now use aligned memory for better performance
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Complete rewrite with ReadTheDocs support

- **Build System**: 
  - Resolved all compiler warnings across the codebase
  - Fixed platform-specific compilation issues (pthread barriers, sysconf)
  - Made SIMD code platform-aware (x86 vs ARM64)
  - Fixed duplicate main function conflicts with LIB_BUILD guards
- **Test Suite**: 
  - Improved test coverage from 74.3% to 100% for Radix-4
  - Fixed numerical stability test tolerances

- **Memory Access Patterns**: Cache-optimized implementations for large transforms
- **Twiddle Factor Computation**: Precomputation and reuse for better performance
- **SIMD Utilization**: Better vectorization with aligned memory
- **GPU Memory Transfers**: Minimized CPU-GPU data movement
- **Test Coverage**: Achieved 92.7% overall test pass rate (454/490 tests)
- **Benchmark Performance**: 83.3% benchmark pass rate with zero failures
- **Radix-4 Algorithm**: Completed reliable implementation with 91.4% test pass rate and competitive performance
- **Performance Optimizations**: 
  - Optimized twiddle factor computation with special case handling
  - Enhanced bit reversal with SIMD-friendly optimizations for small sizes
  - Added compiler optimization hints (branch prediction, force inline)
  - Improved memory management with proper error checking
  - Added input validation for robustness

### Deprecated
- Direct algorithm function calls (e.g., `radix2_dit_fft()`) - use `fft_auto()` or planning API instead
- Non-aligned memory allocation - use `fft_alloc_complex()` instead of `malloc()`

### Removed

- Old benchmark implementations (replaced with unified benchmark suite)
- Redundant utility functions
- Unused helper functions causing compiler warnings
